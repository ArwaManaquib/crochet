  <h1>My Crochet Journey</h1>
  <p>My crochet journey began during the COVID-19 lockdown, when I turned to this craft as a way to cope with isolation and discover creativity. What started as a pastime soon became a source of comfort, patience, and connection. Each stitch reminded me of how hearts can be joined together, just as al-Dai al-Ajal Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin TUS connects Mumineen.</p>

  <p>For my fieldwork, I chose crochet not only to refine my skills but also to explore its deeper purpose as a medium of shared learning and upliftment. I began by researching crochet tools, yarns, and abbreviations, and practiced through YouTube tutorials and online courses. Joining Happy Threads marked an important milestone, where my first assignments like crocheting flowers and coasters helped me build confidence.</p>

  <p>Teaching a friend from scratch became one of the most meaningful parts of my journey. It strengthened our bond and proved how crochet can connect people beyond the craft itself. I also explored crochet commercially during Istefadah in Surat, collaborated remotely with a friend on a Rida design, and created a personal Crochet Guide (PDF) titled “Crochet: A Craft that Connects Hearts.” These projects reflected my belief that crochet is not only creative but also communal and inspirational.</p>

  <p>Through this journey, I developed patience, resilience, and mindfulness, while also realizing crochet’s potential for small-scale entrepreneurship and sustainable income. More importantly, it became a tool for uplifting others and building connections.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, what began as a simple hobby during lockdown has grown into a meaningful pursuit—one that blends creativity, personal growth, and community building.</p>

  <p><em>May Allah Ta’ala grant our beloved Aqa Moula TUS a long and healthy life until the Day of Qayamat. Ameen.</em></p>
